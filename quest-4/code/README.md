# Code Readme

This folder contains our implementation of Quest 4. `esp-code` contains the working code for 8 Fobs, which is equal to the number of esp32s we have between the three of us. Fobs 1-3 are Tony's, fobs 4 & 5 are Shaivya's, and fobs 6-8 are Rogers.

`js-code` contains the code for a server which receives votes from all site leaders. This is then forwarded to an HTML file which handles frontend visualizations.

Each folder has its own readme.
